# Bitcoin Thesis: Long-Term Indicators and Formula for Price Movement

## Objective
To create a framework for identifying Bitcoin price movement and long-term buying opportunities by isolating key inputs and their roles in a predictive formula.

## Formula Structure
**Bitcoin Price Movement Output** = `f(Market Cyclicality, Profitability Metrics, Macro Trends, Technical Indicators, Sentiment Metrics)`

## Key Inputs and Their Roles

### 1. **Market Cyclicality**
- **Definition**: Bitcoin's behavior across historical four-year halving cycles, characterized by accumulation, bull runs, corrections, and consolidation phases.
- **Indicators**:
  - **Halving Events**: Reduction in Bitcoin mining rewards every four years.
  - **Historical Price Trends**: Overlay of past cycles on current performance.
  - **Cycle Alignment Metrics**: Example: Short-term holder cost basis retests during corrections.
- **Role in Formula**:
  - Identifies likely phases of the market.
  - Weighs the probability of further upside or downside.
- **Example Input Value**:
  - Current cycle alignment with historical trends (e.g., "current price is 90% correlated with the 2016â€“2017 cycle").

### 2. **Profitability Metrics**
- **Definition**: Measures the level of profitability or loss for market participants.
- **Indicators**:
  - **MVRV Ratio**: Market Value to Realized Value, particularly for short-term holders (STH).
  - **SoP Ratio**: Spent Output Profit Ratio; indicates whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss.
- **Role in Formula**:
  - Signals overheated or undervalued market conditions.
  - Helps identify when the market is entering accumulation or profit-taking zones.
- **Example Input Value**:
  - STH MVRV > 1.2 (indicating profitability).
  - SoP Ratio < 1 (indicating capitulation and potential buying opportunities).

### 3. **Macro Trends**
- **Definition**: Broader economic and geopolitical factors that impact Bitcoin as a financial asset.
- **Indicators**:
  - **Bond Yields**: Rising yields reduce liquidity, negatively impacting Bitcoin.
  - **Dollar Strength (DXY Index)**: A stronger USD historically correlates with weaker Bitcoin performance.
  - **Political and Regulatory Environment**: Pro-Bitcoin policies (e.g., ETF approvals) support price growth.
- **Role in Formula**:
  - Contextualizes Bitcoin within the broader economic environment.
  - Acts as a multiplier or dampener for Bitcoin demand.
- **Example Input Value**:
  - Bond Yields = 4.5% (high yields indicate liquidity constraints).

### 4. **Technical Indicators**
- **Definition**: Tools used to measure market exhaustion, momentum, and trends.
- **Indicators**:
  - **Choppiness Index**: Measures market trending or consolidation phases.
  - **Volume Profiles**: Identifies zones of high or low traded volume.
  - **Moving Averages**: Tracks price trends and support/resistance levels (e.g., 200-day MA).
- **Role in Formula**:
  - Predicts directional shifts based on trend exhaustion.
  - Highlights key support/resistance levels.
- **Example Input Value**:
  - Choppiness Index = 20 (indicating potential for a strong trend to develop).

### 5. **Sentiment Metrics**
- **Definition**: Gauges market psychology and investor sentiment.
- **Indicators**:
  - **Funding Rates**: Excessively high rates indicate leverage buildup and potential corrections.
  - **Social Media Sentiment**: Tracks general market optimism or pessimism.
  - **Retail vs. Institutional Activity**: Increased retail activity can signal speculative froth.
- **Role in Formula**:
  - Helps assess market euphoria or capitulation levels.
  - Identifies potential contrarian signals.
- **Example Input Value**:
  - Funding Rate =
